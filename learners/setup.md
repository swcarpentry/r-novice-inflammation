This lesson assumes you have current versions of the following installed on your computer:

1. the [R software](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) itself, and
2. [RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).

You also need to download some files to follow this lesson:

1. Make a new folder in your Desktop called `r-novice-inflammation`.
2. Download [r-novice-inflammation-data.zip](data/r-novice-inflammation-data.zip)
  and move the file to this folder.
3. If it's not unzipped yet, unzip it. There should now be a folder called `data` in the `r-novice-inflammation` folder.
4. You can access this folder from the Unix shell with:

```bash
$ cd
$ cd Desktop/r-novice-inflammation/data
```
