::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Understand the three different ways R can address data inside a data frame.
- Combine different methods for addressing data with the assignment operator to update subsets of data.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- What are the different methods for accessing parts of a data frame?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

R is a powerful language for data manipulation.
There are three main ways for addressing data inside R objects.

- By index (subsetting)
- By logical vector
- By name

Lets start by loading some sample data:

```{r readData}
dat <- read.csv(file = 'data/sample.csv', header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Interpreting Rows as Headers

The first row of this csv file is a list of column names.
We used the *header = TRUE* argument to `read.csv` so that R can interpret the file correctly.
We are using the *stringsAsFactors = FALSE* argument to override the default behaviour for R.
Using factors in R is covered in a separate lesson.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Lets take a look at this data.

```{r classDat}
class(dat)
```

R has loaded the contents of the .csv file into a variable called `dat` which is a `data frame`.

We can compactly display the internal structure of a data frame using the  structure function `str`.

```{r strDat}
str(dat)
```

The `str` function tell us that the data has 100 rows and 9 columns. It is also tell us that the data frame is made up of character `chr`, integer `int` and `numeric` vectors.

```{r headDat}
head(dat)
```

The data is the results of an (not real) experiment, looking at the number of aneurysms that formed in the eyes of patients who undertook 3 different treatments.

### Addressing by Index

Data can be accessed by index. We have already seen how square brackets `[` can be used to subset data (sometimes also called "slicing"). The generic format is `dat[row_numbers,column_numbers]`.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Selecting Values

What will be returned by `dat[1, 1]`?
Think about the number of rows and columns you would expect as the result.

:::::::::::::::  solution

```{r select-values}
dat[1, 1]
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

If we leave out a dimension R will interpret this as a request for all values in that dimension.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Selecting More Values

What will be returned by `dat[, 2]`?

:::::::::::::::  solution

```{r select-values-2}
dat[, 2]
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The colon `:` can be used to create a sequence of integers.

```{r colonOperator}
6:9
```

Creates a vector of numbers from 6 to 9.

This can be very useful for addressing data.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Subsetting with Sequences

Use the colon operator to index just the aneurism count data (columns 6 to 9).

:::::::::::::::  solution

```{r subset-sequence}
dat[, 6:9]
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Finally we can use the `c()` (combine) function to address non-sequential rows and columns.

```{r nonsequential_indexing}
dat[c(1, 5, 7, 9), 1:5]
```

Returns the first 5 columns for patients in rows 1,5,7 and 9

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Subsetting Non-Sequential Data

Write code to return the age and gender values for the first 5 patients.

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

```{r subset-nonsequential}
dat[1:5, c(5, 2)]
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Addressing by Name

Columns in an R data frame are named.

```{r column_names}
colnames(dat)
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Default Names

If column names are not specified e.g. using `header = FALSE` in a `read.csv()` function, R assigns default names `V1, V2, ..., Vn`


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

We usually use the `$` operator to address a column by name

```{r named_addressing}
dat$Gender
```

When we extract a single column from a data frame using the `$` operator, R will return a vector of that column class and not a data frame.

```{r}
class(dat$Gender)
class(dat$BloodPressure)
```

Named addressing can also be used in square brackets.

```{r names_addressing_2}
head(dat[, c('Age', 'Gender')])
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Best Practice

Best practice is to address columns by name. Often, you will create or delete columns and the column position will change.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

<br>

Rows in an R data frame can also be named, and rows can also be addressed by their names.
<br>
By default, row names are indices (i.e. position of each row in the data frame):

```{r row_names_1}
rownames(dat)
```

We can add row names as we read in the file with the `row.names` parameter in `read.csv`.<br>
In the following example, we choose the first column *ID* to become the vector of row names of the data frame, with `row.names = 1`.

```{r read_row_names_1}
dat2 <- read.csv(file = 'data/sample.csv', header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, row.names=1)
rownames(dat2)
```

We can now extract one or more rows using those row names:

```{r row_names_addressing_1}
dat2["Sub072", ]
```

```{r row_names_addressing_2}
dat2[c("Sub009", "Sub072"), ]
```

Note that row names must be **unique**!
<br>
For example, if we try and read in the data setting the *Group* column as row names, R will throw an error because values in that column are duplicated:

```{r read_row_names_2}
dat2 <- read.csv(file = 'data/sample.csv', header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, row.names=3)
```

### Addressing by Logical Vector

A logical vector contains only the special values `TRUE` and `FALSE`.

```{r logical_vectors}
c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Truth and Its Opposite

Note the values `TRUE` and `FALSE` are all capital letters and are not quoted.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Logical vectors can be created using `relational operators` e.g. `<, >, ==, !=, %in%`.

```{r logical_vectors_example}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 11, 12, 13)
x < 10

x %in% 1:10
```

We can use logical vectors to select data from a data frame. This is often referred to as *logical indexing*.

```{r logical_vectors_indexing}
index <- dat$Group == 'Control'
dat[index,]$BloodPressure
```

Often this operation is written as one line of code:

```{r logical_vectors_indexing2}
plot(dat[dat$Group == 'Control', ]$BloodPressure)
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Using Logical Indexes

1. Create a scatterplot showing BloodPressure for subjects not in the control group.
2. How many ways are there to index this set of subjects?

:::::::::::::::  solution

1. The code for such a plot:
  ```{r plot-logical}
  plot(dat[dat$Group != 'Control', ]$BloodPressure)
  ```
2. In addition to
  `dat$Group != 'Control'`, one could use
  `dat$Group %in% c("Treatment1", "Treatment2")`.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Combining Addressing and Assignment

The assignment operator `<-` can be combined with addressing.

```{r addressing and assignment}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 11, 12, 13)
x[x < 10] <- 0
x
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Updating a Subset of Values

In this dataset, values for Gender have been recorded as both uppercase `M, F` and lowercase `m, f`.
Combine the addressing and assignment operations to convert all values to lowercase.

:::::::::::::::  solution

```r
dat[dat$Gender == 'M', ]$Gender <- 'm'
dat[dat$Gender == 'F', ]$Gender <- 'f'
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Data in data frames can be addressed by index (subsetting), by logical vector, or by name (columns only).
- Use the `$` operator to address a column by name.
