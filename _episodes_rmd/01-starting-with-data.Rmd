We are studying inflammation in patients who have been given a new treatment for arthritis,
and need to analyze the first dozen data sets.
The data sets are stored in [comma-separated values]({{ page.root }}/reference/#comma-separated-values-csv) (CSV) format. Each row holds the observations for just one patient. Each column holds the inflammation measured in a day, so we have a set of values in successive days.
The first few rows of our first file look like this:

```{r echo = FALSE}
tmp <- read.csv("data/inflammation-01.csv", header = FALSE, nrows = 5)
write.table(tmp, quote = FALSE, sep = ",", row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)
rm(tmp)
```

We want to:

* Load data into memory,
* Calculate the average value of inflammation per day across all patients, and
* Plot the results.

To do all that, we'll have to learn a little bit about programming.

### Loading Data

Let's import the file called `inflammation-01.csv` into our R environment. To import the file, first we need to tell our computer where the file is. We do that by choosing a working directory, that is, a local directory on our computer containing the files we need. This is very important in R. If we forget this step weâ€™ll get an error message saying that the file does not exist. We can set the working directory using the function `setwd`. For this example, we change the path to our new directory at the desktop:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
setwd("~/Desktop/r-novice-inflammation/")
```

Just like in the Unix Shell, we type the command and then press `Enter` (or `return`).
Alternatively you can change the working directory using the RStudio GUI using the menu option `Session` -> `Set Working Directory` -> `Choose Directory...`

The data file is located in the directory `data` inside the working directory. Now we can load the data into R using `read.csv`:

```{r, results="hide"}
read.csv(file = "data/inflammation-01.csv", header = FALSE)
```

The expression `read.csv(...)` is a [function call]({{ page.root }}/reference/#function-call) that asks R to run the function `read.csv`.

`read.csv` has two [arguments]({{ page.root }}/reference/#argument): the name of the file we want to read, and whether the first line of the file contains names for the columns of data.
The filename needs to be a character string (or [string]({{ page.root }}/reference/#string) for short), so we put it in quotes. Assigning the second argument, `header`, to be `FALSE` indicates that the data file does not have column headers. We'll talk more about the value `FALSE`, and its converse `TRUE`, in lesson 04.

> importing your own data in the future. You can learn more about these
> options in this supplementary [lesson]({{ page.root }}/11-supp-read-write-csv/).
{: .callout}

> ## Loading Data with Headers
>
> What happens if you forget to put `header = FALSE`? The default value is `header = TRUE`, which you can check with `?read.csv` or `help(read.csv)`. What do you expect will happen if you leave the default value? Before you run any code, think about what will happen to the first few rows of your data frame, and its overall size. Then run the following code and see if your expectations agree:

> read.csv(file = "data/inflammation-01.csv")
> ~~~

{: .challenge}

> ## Reading Different Decimal Point Formats
>
> Depending on the country you live in, your standard can use the dot or the comma as decimal mark.
> Also, different devices or software can generate data with different decimal points.
> Take a look at `?read.csv` and write the code to load a file called `commadec.txt` that has numeric values with commas as decimal mark, separated by semicolons.
{: .challenge}

A function will perform its given action on whatever value is passed to the argument(s).
For example, in this case if we provided the name of a different file to the argument `file`, `read.csv` would read that instead.
We'll learn more about the details of functions and their arguments in the next lesson.

Since we didn't tell it to do anything else with the function's output, the console will display the full contents of the file `inflammation-01.csv`.
Try it out.

`read.csv` reads the file, but we can't use data unless we assign it to a variable.
We can think of a variable as a container with a name, such as `x`, `current_temperature`, or `subject_id` that contains one or more values.
We can create a new variable and assign a value to it using `<-`

```{r}
weight_kg <- 55
```

Once a variable has a value, we can print it by typing the name of the variable and hitting `Enter` (or `return`).
In general, R will print to the console any object returned by a function or operation *unless* we assign it to a variable.

```{r}
weight_kg
```

We can do arithmetics with the variable:

```{r}
# weight in pounds:
2.2 * weight_kg
```

> ## Commenting
>
> We can add comments to our code using the `#` character. It is useful to
> document our code in this way so that others (and us the next time we
> read it) have an easier time following what the code is doing.
{: .callout}

We can also change an variable's value by assigning it a new value:

```{r}
weight_kg <- 57.5
# weight in kilograms is now
weight_kg
```
> ## Variable Naming Conventions
>
> Historically, R programmers have used a variety of conventions for naming variables. The `.` character
> in R can be a valid part of a variable name; thus the above assignment could have easily been `weight.kg <- 57.5`.
> This is often confusing to R newcomers who have programmed in languages where `.` has a more significant meaning.
> Today, most R programmers 1) start variable names with lower case letters, 2) separate words in variable names with
> underscores, and 3) use only lowercase letters, underscores, and numbers in variable names. The book *R Packages* includes
> a [chapter](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/style.html) on this and other style considerations.
{: .callout}

If we imagine the variable as a sticky note with a name written on it,
assignment is like putting the sticky note on a particular value:

<img src="../fig/python-sticky-note-variables-01.svg" alt="Variables as Sticky Notes" />

This means that assigning a value to one object does not change the values of other variables.
For example, let's store the subject's weight in pounds in a variable:

```{r}
weight_lb <- 2.2 * weight_kg
# weight in kg...
weight_kg
# ...and in pounds
weight_lb
```

<img src="../fig/python-sticky-note-variables-02.svg" alt="Creating Another Variable" />

and then change `weight_kg`:

```{r}
weight_kg <- 100.0
# weight in kg now...
weight_kg
# ...and weight in pounds still
weight_lb
```

<img src="../fig/python-sticky-note-variables-03.svg" alt="Updating a Variable" />

Since `weight_lb` doesn't "remember" where its value came from, it isn't automatically updated when `weight_kg` changes.
This is different from the way spreadsheets work.

> ## Printing with Parentheses
>
> An alternative way to print the value of a variable is to use () around the assignment statement.
> As an example: `(total_weight <- weight_kg + weight_lb)` adds the values of `weight_kg` and `weight_lb`,
> assigns the result to the `total_weight`,
> and finally prints the assigned value of the variable `total_weight`.
{: .callout}

Now that we know how to assign things to variables, let's re-run `read.csv` and save its result into a variable called 'dat':

```{r}
dat <- read.csv(file = "data/inflammation-01.csv", header = FALSE)
```

This statement doesn't produce any output because the assignment doesn't display anything.
If we want to check if our data has been loaded, we can print the variable's value by typing the name of the variable `dat`. However, for large data sets it is convenient to use the function `head` to display only the first few rows of data.


```{r}
head(dat)
```

> ~~~

### Manipulating Data

Now that our data are loaded into R, we can start doing things with them.
First, let's ask what type of thing `dat` is:

```{r}
class(dat)
```

The output tells us that it is a data frame. We can think of this as a spreadsheet in MS Excel, which many of us are familiar with.
Data frames are very useful for organizing data and you will find them elsewhere when programming in R. A typical data frame of experimental data contains individual observations in rows and variables in columns.

We can see the shape, or [dimensions]({{ page.root }}/reference/#dimensions-of-an-array), of the data frame with the function `dim`:

```{r}
dim(dat)
```

This tells us that our data frame, `dat`, has `r nrow(dat)` rows and `r ncol(dat)` columns.

At the moment, the columns of our data frame are named as they were in the csv file `inflammation-01.csv`. We can find the names of `dat` using the command `names`:

```{r}
names(dat)
```

We know that each row represents one patient and each column represents one time point. It is a good programing practice to use column names that indicate as good as possible the nature of the data. In our case, columns represent time points. Thus, let's modify our column names to T1, T2, T3 and so on. For this, we will use a comman called `gsub`:

```{r}
# Modify column names
names(dat) <- gsub("V", "T", names(dat))
# Show column names
names(dat)
```

The comman `gsub` works as the find/replace option found in Excell. In the code above, the `gsub` function is defining that every letter `V` found in the column names of `dat` should be replaced by a letter `T`. Remember that R is case sensitive, so upper and lower cases matter. This is how the data frame looks like now:

```{r}
head(dat)
```

If we want to get a single value from the data frame, we can provide an [index]({{ page.root }}/reference/#index) in square brackets. The first number specifies the row and the second the column:

```{r}
# first value in dat
dat[1, 1]
# middle value in dat
dat[30, 20]
```

An index like `[30, 20]` selects a single element of a data frame, but we can select whole sections as well.
For example, we can select the first ten days (columns) of values for the first four patients (rows) like this:

```{r}
dat[1:4, 1:10]
```

The [slice]({{ page.root }}/reference/#slice) `1:4` means, "Start at index 1 and go to index 4."

The slice does not need to start at 1, e.g. the line below selects rows 5 through 10:

```{r}
dat[5:10, 1:10]
```
We can use the function `c`, which stands for **c**ombine, to select non-contiguous values:

```{r}
dat[c(3, 8, 37, 56), c(10, 14, 29)]
```

We also don't have to provide a slice for either the rows or the columns.
If we don't include a slice for the rows, R returns all the rows; if we don't include a slice for the columns, R returns all the columns.
If we don't provide a slice for either rows or columns, e.g. `dat[, ]`, R returns the full data frame.

```{r}
# All columns from row 5
dat[5, ]
# All rows from column 16
dat[, 16]
```

> ## Addressing Columns by Name
>
> Columns can also be addressed by name, with either the `$` operator (ie. `dat$Age`) or square brackets (ie. `dat[,'Age']`).
> You can learn more about subsetting by column name in this supplementary [lesson]({{ page.root }}/10-supp-addressing-data/).
{: .callout}

Now let's perform some common mathematical operations to learn more about our inflammation data.
When analyzing data we often want to look at partial statistics, such as the maximum value per patient or the average value per day.
One way to do this is to select the data we want to create a new temporary data frame, and then perform the calculation on this subset:

```{r}
# first row, all of the columns
patient_1 <- dat[1, ]
# max inflammation for patient 1
max(patient_1)
```

> ## Forcing Conversion
>
> The code above may give you an error in some R installations,
> since R does not automatically convert a sliced row of a `data.frame` to a vector.
> (Confusingly, sliced columns are automatically converted.)
> If this happens, you can use the `as.numeric` command to convert the row of data to a numeric vector:
>
> `patient_1 <- as.numeric(dat[1, ])`
>
> `max(patient_1)`
>
> You can also check the `class` of each object:
>
> `class(dat[1, ])`
>
> `class(as.numeric(dat[1, ]))`
{: .callout}

We don't actually need to store the row in a variable of its own.
Instead, we can combine the selection and the function call:

```{r}
# max inflammation for patient 2
max(dat[2, ])
```

R also has functions for other common calculations, e.g. finding the minimum, mean, median, and standard deviation of the data:

```{r}
# minimum inflammation on day 7
min(dat[, 7])
# mean inflammation on day 7
mean(dat[, 7])
# median inflammation on day 7
median(dat[, 7])
# standard deviation of inflammation on day 7
sd(dat[, 7])
```

R also has a function that summaries the previous common calculations:

```{r}
# Summarize function
summary(dat[,1:4])
```

For every column in the data frame, the function "summary" calculates: the minimun value, the first quartile, the median, the mean, the third quartile and the max value, given helpful details about the sample distribution.


What if we need the maximum inflammation for all patients, or the average for each day?
As the diagram below shows, we want to perform the operation across a margin of the data frame:

<img src="../fig/r-operations-across-axes.svg" alt="Operations Across Axes" />

To support this, we can use the `apply` function.

> ## Getting Help
>
> To learn about a function in R, e.g. `apply`, we can read its help
> documention by running `help(apply)` or `?apply`.
{: .callout}

`apply` allows us to repeat a function on all of the rows (`MARGIN = 1`) or columns (`MARGIN = 2`) of a data frame.

Thus, to obtain the average inflammation of each patient we will need to calculate the mean of all of the rows (`MARGIN = 1`) of the data frame.

```{r}
avg_patient_inflammation <- apply(dat, 1, mean)
```

And to obtain the average inflammation of each day we will need to calculate the mean of all of the columns (`MARGIN = 2`) of the data frame.

```{r}
avg_day_inflammation <- apply(dat, 2, mean)
```

Since the second argument to `apply` is `MARGIN`, the above command is equivalent to `apply(dat, MARGIN = 2, mean)`.
We'll learn why this is so in the next lesson.

### Plotting

The mathematician Richard Hamming once said, "The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers," and the best way to develop insight is often to visualize data.
Visualization deserves an entire lecture (or course) of its own, but we can explore a few of R's plotting features.

Let's take a look at the average inflammation over time.
Recall that we already calculated these values above using `apply(dat, 2, mean)` and saved them in the variable `avg_day_inflammation`.
Plotting the values is done with the function `plot`.

```{r plot-avg-inflammation}
plot(avg_day_inflammation)
```

Above, we gave the function `plot` a vector of numbers corresponding to the average inflammation per day across all patients.
`plot` created a scatter plot where the y-axis is the average inflammation level and the x-axis is the order, or index, of the values in the vector, which in this case correspond to the 40 days of treatment.
The result is roughly a linear rise and fall, which is suspicious: based on other studies, we expect a sharper rise and slower fall.
Let's have a look at two other statistics: the maximum and minimum inflammation per day.

```{r plot-max-inflammation}
max_day_inflammation <- apply(dat, 2, max)
plot(max_day_inflammation)
```

```{r plot-min-inflammation}
min_day_inflammation <- apply(dat, 2, min)
plot(min_day_inflammation)
```

The maximum value rises and falls perfectly smoothly, while the minimum seems to be a step function. Neither result seems particularly likely, so either there's a mistake in our calculations or something is wrong with our data.
